Inventory and stock management for the e-commerce ecosystem.

## Dependencies
Reviewed capability decisions are recorded in docs/06_architecture/INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md.

## Upstream Traceability
BUSINESS.md and existing repository architecture documentation define the current intent.

## Downstream Artifacts
The integration contract, invariants, and bootstrap planning chain are the canonical IPS outputs.
