# Goal 24 Current-Head Verifier Sync - 2026-07-04

IPS: Vision -> Goal 24 paid/provider smoke cleanup must validate against the latest merged source truth before any side-effectful runtime attempt; Goal Impact -> focused verifiers now fail closed if they only see historical Wave A-G source-governance markers; System -> Payments, Catalog, FlipFlop, Orders, and Warehouse keep separate ownership while sharing current-head validation evidence; Feature -> current-head verifier sync; Task -> add source-only marker coverage; Execution Plan -> docs/status/report/verifier only, no live side effects; Coding Prompt -> preserve blockers and do not infer stock effects from Payments refund state; Code -> focused verifier current-head assertion; Validation -> focused Goal 24 verifier plus git diff check; State Update -> source-integrated-runtime-hard-stopped.

Decision: [RESOLVED/NARROWED: Goal 24 current-head verifier sync GOAL24-CURRENT-HEADS-2026-07-04H requires Auth c389c1e, Payments 0207876 docs: sync goal24 fiobanka runtime image evidence, Catalog 0e37b4c docs: sync goal24 catalog payments runtime image evidence, FlipFlop 1113b9e docs: consume goal24 auth token proof in verifier, Orders 154c5cd docs: sync goal24 orders payments runtime image evidence, and Warehouse 0289dc2 docs: require goal24 current heads in verifier as the pre-H validation input heads; the H sync commits and later source-only status commits are validation evidence only; historical Wave A-G markers are evidence only; runtime side effects remain blocked]

Historical Wave A-G markers remain evidence for planning lineage only. They are not renewed runtime authority and do not replace the pre-H validation input heads above; H sync commits and later source-only status commits are validation evidence only.

Remaining blockers:

- [MISSING: fresh Auth actor-bound token generated through the Auth c389c1e no-print/no-decode/no-persist pattern for the exact guarded discount-fixture step].
- [MISSING: sanitized auth/admin evidence path for guarded discount-code generation using the fresh selected actor-bound token].
- [MISSING: named human Payments/provider rollback execution owner with bank/refund authority for runtime].
- [MISSING: future paymentId/orderId/variableSymbolHash/providerTransactionHash for exact smoke].
- [MISSING: concrete side-effectful rollback run id and cleanup idempotency keys].
- [MISSING: exact Orders cleanup packet and sideEffectsHandled acknowledgements].
- [MISSING: named runtime Orders cancellation actor/approvedBy and exact target order hash/state for the paid/provider packet].
- [MISSING: owner-approved payment/warehouse/notification/crm/channel sideEffectsHandled acknowledgements for the selected central order hash].
- [MISSING: live current target row readback at execution time].
- [RESOLVED/NARROWED: approval intake 003 supplies the bounded smoke execution window]; [MISSING: Warehouse hold/release duration].
- [MISSING: final owner approval before any live Warehouse reservation/cleanup mutation].
- [MISSING: approved runtime route invocation evidence; do not call the route until all packet fields are present].
- [MISSING: final redacted evidence path for required provider, Orders, Warehouse, and channel cleanup proof].

Boundaries: no checkout, payment creation, provider call, refund/reversal, Orders route invocation, Warehouse mutation, channel cleanup, deploy, migration, DB write, secret/token output, or raw customer/order/payment/provider evidence occurred.
