# Execution Plan: TASK-001

status: validated
completeness_level: complete

## Upstream Traceability
../11_tasks/TASK-001-bootstrap-service.md, ../22_goal_impact/GOAL-IMPACT-TASK-001.md, and ../12_validation/VAL-TASK-001-bootstrap-service.md.

## Scope
Required IPS documents and adoption profile.

## Non-Goals
No runtime source, manifest, secret, or deployment changes.

## Project Invariants
Preserve documented ownership and safety boundaries.

## Sensitive-Data Handling
Use documented facts only; never copy credential or secret values.

## Contract Validation Plan
Compare decisions to existing system and architecture documentation.

## Replay and Determinism Plan
Validator re-evaluates unchanged files consistently.

## Files to Inspect
Top-level governance files and existing relevant documentation.

## Files to Create
Canonical IPS documents and ips-adoption.json.

## Files to Modify
Top-level governance documents reformatted to IPS headings.

## Files That Must Not Be Modified
Source, manifests, Dockerfiles, secrets, and deploy scripts.

## Implementation Steps
Scaffold, populate factual artifacts, review, validate, and commit.

## Parallel Execution
Ready now: one workstream. Shared files: none. Integration and validation owner: onboarding worker. Merge order: single commit.

## Blockers
No blockers were identified for this documentation-only task.

## Test Plan
Run authoritative planning validator.

## Validation Plan
Resolve every validator error.

## Gate Commands
python3 ../intent-preservation-system/scripts/validate_adoption_profile.py --root . --phase planning

## Documentation Updates
Update canonical IPS artifacts.

## Rollback Plan
Revert documentation commit if restructuring is factually inaccurate.

## Handoff
Future workers read canonical artifacts before implementation.

## Completion Checklist
Files, approvals, sixteen reviews, and validator result are complete.
